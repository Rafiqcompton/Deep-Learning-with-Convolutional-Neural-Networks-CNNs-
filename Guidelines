Install TensorFlow library: pip install tensorflow
Prepare your dataset with labeled images.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Define the CNN architecture using Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.
Compile the model with appropriate loss and optimizer functions.
Train the model on the training set using model.fit().
Evaluate the model on the testing set using model.evaluate().
Use the trained model for predictions.
